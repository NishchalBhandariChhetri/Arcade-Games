Overview
The Arcade Games Collection is a web-based project that brings together four engaging games. Each game is implemented as a standalone module with its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance. The games are responsive and playable in modern web browsers.
Games Included

Snake: Navigate a growing snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with itself or the walls.
Pong: A classic two-player table tennis game where you hit a ball back and forth.
Guess the US State: Test your geography knowledge by identifying US states based on clues or visuals.
Rock Paper Scissors: A simple hand game where you compete against the computer in a best-of series.

No additional dependencies or servers are required, as the games run entirely in the browser.

How to Play:

Snake: Use arrow keys to control the snake. Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
Pong: Use the up/down arrow keys (or W/S for player 2) to move the paddles. Hit the ball past your opponent to score points.
Guess the US State: Follow on-screen prompts to guess the state based on clues or a map. Input your answer via text or selection.
Rock Paper Scissors: Click on Rock, Paper, or Scissors to play against the computer. The first to win a set number of rounds wins.

Each game includes on-screen instructions for controls and objectives.
Technologies Used

HTML: Structures the game interfaces and menus.
